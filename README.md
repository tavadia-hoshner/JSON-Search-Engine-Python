```
It requires a JSON file to read the data from.

## Recipe Finder Using Keywords

> ### Search Type:
> #### 1. Normal: The most basic search, the recipes are ordered by the maximum occurerences of the keywords.
> #### 2. Simple: Provides you with the recipes that have the least number of indegredients and directions.
> #### 3. Healthy: Certain recipes have nutritional values provided, using a special formula we sort the food items from most healthy to least healthy.

## Use Your Own JSON FIle
